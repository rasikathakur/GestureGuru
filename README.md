## Definition
The communication barrier between deaf individuals and those who do not understand sign language significantly limits social inclusion and interaction. Traditional methods of learning sign language are often time-consuming and inaccessible, while real-time translation tools are scarce. GestureGuru addresses these challenges, enabling effective interaction in education, employment, and everyday scenarios.
